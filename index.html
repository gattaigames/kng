          <h2>I'm a Digital Communications Specialist from Singapore.</h2>

          <p>
            Iâ€™m passionate about technology and how it can be used to make work and life better.
            <p>
            A problem solver, I actively identify ways to harness technology as an enabler to improve processes and optimize according to best practices.
            <p>
            Iâ€™m an Assistant Manager at NUS Centre for Future-ready Graduates, where I am in charge of digital communications as part of the communications team. Besides developing email marketing campaigns, I conceptualize our digital strategy, manage our social media and website, and explore ways to integrate our services to improve our work.
            <p>
            Before I joined NUS, I was a Senior Executive at Ngee Ann Polytechnicâ€™s Corporate Communcations Office where I was in charge of website management, web analytics, social media reporting and managing digital projects. I also organised workshops and provided course counselling for secondary school students.
            <p>
            In my first job, I was a Senior Associate at global communications agency Cohn & Wolfe servicing 3 accounts for Dell Asia-Pacific and Japan. Besides securing media coverage and executive interviews for Dellâ€™s regional vice-presidents, I facilitated analyst briefings for Dellâ€™s business units, and worked closely with Dellâ€™s sales teams in 8 countries for their internal customer success stories.

            <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
            <p>
            <b>How many people actually visit our website, and how many people actually read our emails?</b>
            <p>
            Prior to 2016, Ngee Ann Polytechnicâ€™s website was being tracked by a server-side analytics tool that was not user-friendly and did not meet our needs.
            <p>
            As we did not have in-house capabilities, I was offered the role to explore and implement web analytics for our digital platforms.
            <p>
            After obtaining my Google Analytics Individual Qualification within 2 days, I implemented Google Analytics via Google Tag Manager, and integrated all our website and microsites into a single account so that we can track visitorsâ€™ journey across all our web properties.
            <p>
            We also started using Custom Campaigns to track the open rates of our email campaigns. We were not tracking our email campaigns previously and had no data at all.
            <p>
            During our website revamp, we also used the page visit data to determine which web pages to remove.

            <h3>360Â° Video</h3>
            <p>
            <b>How do we let secondary school students know that learning in a polytechnic is different from learning in a junior college?</b>
            <p>
            To showcase the polytechnicâ€™s unique learning environment and campus facilities without visiting the campus in person, we commissioned a 360Â° video with a third party vendor.
            <p>
            I was the lead for this project and was responsible for vendor sourcing, script, talent casting, and direction.

            <p>
            <b>How can we let secondary school students see what Ngee Ann Polytechnic is like if they canâ€™t visit our campus in person?</b>
            <p>
            The 360Â° video only showcased the learning facilities; we decided to commission a virtual tour to highlight the entire campus experience including co-curricular activities (CCAs), food outlets, and more.
            <p>
              I was once again the project lead and took charge of vendor sourcing, talent casting, and direction.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            The main website underwent a major revamp in 2017 to be mobile-responsive and more marketing-driven.
            <p>
            However, the revamp only covered the major subsites; some of the minor subsites were not revamped as part of the project.
            <p>
            Having picked up Bootstrap 3 on my own while on the job, I redeveloped these subsites and saved close to $20,000 in vendor costs.
          </p>
          </div>

          <div class="descDivC">
          <h3>e-Newsletter</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Before I joined the organisation, the weekly e-newsletter was done painstakingly in Word, then pasted into an email. It was not mobile-responsive, did not have a web version, and took up to a full dayâ€™s work.
            <p>
            The teammates had to submit the information in an Excel file hosted on a shared server; when a user is logged in, another user cannot access the file until the first user logs out.
            <p>
            I automated the workflow and moved it onto the web â€“ teammates now submit information using a web-based form which can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. The information is then saved in CSV format and imported into the website, saving time and effort.
            <p>
            The new e-newsletter is now mobile-responsive, can be accessed anytime, anywhere without checking the email inbox, shareable, and help to drive traffic to the website.
          </p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a miles enthusiast â€“ I collect air miles and hotel loyalty points to redeem business class tickets and get suite upgrades.
            <p>
            Iâ€™m a community manager on The Milelion Telegram group.
            <p>
            My other interests include Mambo Jambo and movies.
